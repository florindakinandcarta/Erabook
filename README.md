This is an app in which you can browse books and search them up. 
The books are parsed from a .json file. You can search a specific book by the author or by the title, mark a book favorite and remove it. 
It has a count down timer in which you can select the time and when the time is up you'll get a notification. 
You can look the details of the book and the description of the book is fetched from the Wikipedia web page. 
You can share the details of the book from the Erabook app to another app of your chosing. 
If you want to buy that specific book the app will redirect you to the default browser in your device to the Barnes And Noble Page(currently barnesandnoble.com is having some problems)
The discover fragment is still not implemented the idea is that there I'll use the Google Books API to search a book in the whole internet,
and the sign in with the Google Acc. option is not fully functional. 

Below you'll find some screenshots from the app.
